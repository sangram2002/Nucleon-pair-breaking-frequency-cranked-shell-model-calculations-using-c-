*** NOTE THAT SOME ENSDF ASSIGNMENTS ARE NOT PRESERVED ***

PLEASE NOTE that RadWare-format files cannot preserve,
 in any strict sense, the careful data assignments made by
 nuclear data evaluators and stored in the ENSDF files.
 The RadWare format is much more limited than the ENSDF one;
 for example, in RadWare, transition multipolarities are
 deduced from the level spins and parities, while in ENSDF a
 transition may have no multipolarity assigned, or one assigned
 in a range of different ways.  Other quantities required by
 the RadWare format may or may not be assigned in the ENSDF
 file, and some quantities in ENSDF (lifetimes, for example)
 do not have any RadWare-format equivalent.  For this reason,
 DO NOT assume that this file gives a true representation of
 the assignments made (or not made) in ENSDF!

ENSDF Gamma intensities have been renormalized.

For this nucleus, a level spin label of -1/2 indicates
 that in ENSDF either none or multiple JPI was assigned.
